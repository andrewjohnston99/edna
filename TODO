 -- Changed StreamingContext to SimpleStreamingContext




---------------
> next steps

    - pass lists to emit - so process can emit multiple items per record, and needs to pass them out
        - then chained processes will operate on each element of list, and emit their own
        - if list of list with chained process, emit giant list
        - Emitter will accept lists
        - process needs to emit singleton list

> async io 
    - need a job graph
    - when execute is called, internally, build the job graph
    - then (for now), each process exists independently
    - launch each process (with byte buffers) and have them communicate using asyncio

    - Future steps -- optimizer to combine 1-to-1 processes.
